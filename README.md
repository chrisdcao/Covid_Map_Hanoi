# Covid Map Hanoi
My on-going project, implementing Recurrent Neural Network for Named Entity Recognition task on Covid newspaper.

The model will read and extract location info, along with infos like patient ID (if have). 

After extraction, an automated Python script will run to add the new information into MySQL Database.

Here's a demo of the map on web:
